**tl;dr** _I discuss my own version of fitness: being active and aware
  of my body, both so that I do not neglect it, nor abuse it. I
  discuss my goals, both current and near-future. And I specifically
  outline a few things I am not very interested in persuing._

'Though I have since surpassed this result on the treadmill, I
distinctly remember it being the first one I was really proud of after
having completed my run. I was so happy and excited to see how much I
had improved that I showed everyone, and told a lot of people about
it. Before this one, I really had been keeping records out of a simple
idea to keep myself honest... After all, if I posted a result every
Monday, and didn't post one this Monday, people would think I did not
run! But now, I do it also to keep tabs on my progress. Because, in
the end, I am proud of myself for sticking with it long enough to
improve.'){:.display}](http://imgur.com/aOqWOPL)

I go to the gym three times a week.

This is, by far, the most notable change I have made in my life since
2014 rolled around; People notice I am gone, since it takes about an
hour and a half of my day, including travel. I mostly rent a treadmill
from them; I have free weights at home, and mostly use bodyweight
exercises, anyway. But I have been able to notice an improvement to my
running speed, and discuss it with people sometimes.

This leads, sometimes, to a question about my goals in fitness. Do I
plan to actually _run_ an 8k or a Marathon? How long am I going to
cut calories? Do I just care about how I _look_, or do I want to
_compete_?

Well, I wanted to answer these questions (and, have a platform for
talking about my experiences with _Proper Excercise_, _Proper Diet_, and
_Proper Habits_), and so I started this blog.

My physical lifestyle: I want to be aware of my body at all times,
neither neglecting its needs nor abusing it, and keeping it active
enough so that it does not fall apart but not so active that
it... falls apart.

This extends to three main areas:

1. __Exercise/Physical Activity:__ I want to maintain some level of the
   commonly-thought-of idea of fitness. I just like how my body feels
   after it is used; it feels good to be active.

   Also, I have pretty bad asthma, and it gets worse when I am
   sedentary for too long. Heart Disease also runs in my family. Also,
   on a bit of a more personal level, I hate being too weak to do
   things.

   So, to combat all of these things, I must exercise... but I also
   know people who have been athletes for decades, and their bodies
   are falling apart at a relatively young age. So, I do not want to
   overdo it, either.

2. __Diet:__ No, not always cutting calories. I want to be aware of what I
   am consuming, though, so I will probably always (to the best of my
   ability, anyway) keep track of calories, carbohydrates, fats, and
   proteins that are in what I choose to eat.

   About a nine months ago I got really serious about losing some fat
   which I had gained when my grandmother was passing away. I will
   talk more about that in another article. To summarize here, though,
   I do not want to let my body get that out of hand again... but I
   also do not want to be a skeleton, either.


   Like in __Exercise__, I like being strong enough to do things and
   be healthy. I have no desires to be ultra muscled (or ultra thin),
   though.

3. __Habit:__ I have a really bad habit of not sleeping enough. I used to
   sleep only a couple of hours a night; I have worked on it and
   gotten it to an average of about 6. This is something I want to
   improve upon. Running at the gym is a habit I want to keep. Keeping
   track of my calories. Writing for my blogs.

   I used to hate habit, because I had seen some people use habit as
   an excuse not to adapt to life as it happens, instead choosing to
   cling to a rigid schedule.

   I am working on finding a balance with habits as well: Not so loose
   that I never consistantly do anything, but not so rigid that my day
   is ruined if I cannot make it happen. This is the hardest section
   for me.

In terms of my short term goals: I want to hit 180 lbs again. After I
do that, I will probably attempt to build up some strength, though I
am not sure on the specifics of the programs I will follow. I want to
start sleeping 7.5 hours a night, and I want to start hiking,
eventually (read: when the weather is warm again).

What I am _not_ interested in: Team Sports, Running or Biking
Competitions, Bodybuilding or Model-like Dieting, and Fad Diets. More
on each of these later.

This is my Lifestyle.

See You Next Time,
