So, I have decided to do a [Chesslocke][chesslocke] of Pokemon Blue.

Basically, this limits my run through of the game to catching only 16
pokemon: 1 King (starter), 1 Queen, 2 Bishops, 2 Rooks, 2 Knights, and
8 Pawns. The Rules for this Nuzlocke derivative would come into effect
after __I receive my 5 free Pokeballs from Professor Oak__.

I have been dubbed Jalaini (pronounced like ha-la-i-ni) by two of my
friends, who suggested the words "Jalapeno" and "Tortillini" for
character names. This makes my rival's name "Torpeno".

My trainer ID is __47794__, which means (according to the optional rule I am
using) my starter is the Fire type, Charmander. As a theme, all of my
pokemon will be named after spices. I named my charmander after one of
my favorites: "Cinnamon".

__Cinnamon__ defeated Torpeno's Squirtle fairly handily, though the
rules of the Challenge were not yet in effect. We easily made it to
_Viridian City_ and back, to deliver Oak's Parcel to him. In exchange,
we recieved the high tech encyclopedia, __Pokedex__.

Excited and brave, we never ran from any pokemon who chose to
challenge us during this time. On our way to scope out our goal,
_Victory Road_, we once again ran into our rival. However, Torpeno had
caught himself a Pidgey.

Luckily, the rules of the challenge were still not quite in effect. We
had quite a difficult time beating this doubly strong combo, thought
we did eventually come out on top.

Then, being the responsible kid I am, I ran back to tell on him to his
grandfather, Professor Oak.

He gave me 5 pokeballs for my troubles, and the full rules of the
challenge came into effect. Cinnamon, now level 11, and I set out that
very minute, ready for whatever kind of adventure would unfold.
