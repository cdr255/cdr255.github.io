**tl;dr:** _In this inaugural post to the blog, I talk about
  generating the world I will be using for my dwarf fortress
  playthroughs on it, how long it took, and some interesting facts
  about it according to the info generated by [Dwarf Fortress][df]._

'This map looks amazing, to me. It may have taken quite a long time
for the program to generate this world, but I am more than pleased
with it. Just the amount of depth it has! And, to answer a question
you may have: No, I do not play with a tileset. I just do not enjoy it
as much. The lack of conventional graphics in this game and others
just lends to my imagination being able to substitute in my own
interpertation of what I am seeing... and that is kinda the entire
point of this blog, too. Anyway, I am considering taking this map and
using it as the base for a world I am creating for my Pathfinder
Campaign. If that develops, I definitely will mention it on one of my
blogs.'){:.display}](http://imgur.com/pNXV5pY)

Hello and Welcome to my newest blog, where I take my playthroughs of
Roguelikes and [Dwarf Fortress][df] and use them as a basis for my own
little writings. Today, I am talking about the latter- and
specifically, about the world I have generated _just_ for this blog.

First, let me explain a bit, for those who are not as familiar with
[Dwarf Fortress][df] as I am: When You begin to play the game, You cannot
actually just start playing. First, You must generate a world to play
in. This is one of the biggest draws of the game for me; while there
will be many similarities between different plays, no two worlds are
the same.

My world has been given the name __Buzong Ustra: The World of
Forever__- Which I think is a pretty good and memorable name. It took
_hours_ to generate, due in part to the many high settings I had
chosen for the world: For instance, in this world, 1150 years have
transpired already. There are no less than _eighty-two (82)_ different
civilizations (hoping mine will be number 83!), all waiting to come
into contact with my 7 starting dwarves.

I will be making a tab (like those above reading "Home" and "About")
for Buzong Ustra, where I will chronicle a bit more information. But I
wanted to start things off with an informal, quick update like this,
in my own voice.

As I continue to prepare for this journey, I will be taking on the
role of the dwarves: more often than not, probably the _Expedition
Leader_. I still must assemble and embark, and will log that process
here, but probably under their voice, more often than not. I will
probably have around three (3) to four (4) more posts in this series
before I actually begin play... afterwhich, barring important posts, I
am hoping to be able to simply stay in character as the Expedition
Leader(s).

And do not worry: I will not just be covering [Dwarf Fortress][df]. I
already have a character generated for my playthrough of [ADOM][adom], which
will probably be my next post. And, fairly often, I will update
blog-wide with a quick summary of how each one of my concurrent
playthroughs is doing, in a semi-shameless attempt to cross promote
between series.

Until Next Time.
