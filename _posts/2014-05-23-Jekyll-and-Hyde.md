I have been blogging and maintaining personal websites for years.

My most recent foray has been, largely, a success: I have had 8
different blogs hosted by [Blogger][blogger] over the last two
years. However, the downsides to this are twofold.

First, and foremost: I have __Eight__ blogs. Content on all of them
has been a trickle, mostly because I tend to focus on updating one or
two of them instead of each one in succession. This balkanization of
my blogging has been a big detrement to me for a while, so I recently
decided that it might be smart to go down to one blog only... at least
for a while.

Second... I write all of my posts using the markup language
[kramdown][kramdown] (which is really a dialect of
[markdown][md]). Blogger supports posts written in only two formats:
HTML, and their own "Rich Text Editor."

What this means for me is that I have to compile my posts on my own
computer before uploading them to the web. So, why put up with some of
the annoyances of [Blogger][blogger] if I am doing static site
generation anyway?

And so, I chose to move to [Jekyll][jekyll]. It was quite a process,
but that is a different post. I am very happy with it so far, and will
update more on it as I begin to migrate everything over to it.

Hope it all goes smoothly from here on out.
