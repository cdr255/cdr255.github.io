About 10 (or, wow, 13 now... I am getting *old*) years ago, I stumbled
upon [ESR's guide][hacker] on learning to "Become a Hacker." That link
goes to the relevant section for this post, but if You are interested
in becoming active with Your computer I recommend reading the entire
thing.

It is a good thing I did. It set me on the right path, though I have
chosen a very interesting way to follow it so far... I started with
__C++__ and, though I have learned a great many concepts I would not
have learned otherwise, it could easily be argued that I could have
learned so much more had I started with a language such as
[Python][python]. In fact, ESR himself says so, in that very article.

With my move mostly settled, I am able to (once again) renew my
personal efforts in learning to design and implement programs. This
article is meant to outline the various things I want to do; This is a
sort of roadmap for my progress in this area. Of course, my own
mileage may vary.

1. Learn to use [Java][java], [Perl][perl], [Ruby][ruby] and
   [Lisp][lisp] better.

   I have focussed far too much on [C++][cpp], [Python][python], and
   [HTML/CSS][html] these past few years (but mostly C++) and so, first on
   my list is to shore up my weaknesses in other commonly used
   languages.

2. Learn more about __constructing algorithms__, __designing
   programs__, and __implementing concepts__ from a _language
   agnostic_ standpoint.

   Syntax is one thing, but the __ideas__ behind a lot of programs
   (and translating those ideas _into_ the syntax) is another, and a
   much more important one.

3. __Complete__ projects.

   No matter how small, insignigicant, or seemingly arbitrary, it is
   _vital_ to both my motivation and my progress to actually finish
   projects, instead of abandoning them halfway through.

I will be posting on here a lot about the things I learn, in the hopes
that doing so will further cement the information in my mind. Other
than that, I should get coding.
