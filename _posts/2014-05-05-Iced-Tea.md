**tl;dr:** _A quick and easy sugar drink with a nice amount of
  caffeine. Perfect for getting me through the day, even if the day is
  opposed to the idea._

'I store the finished product described here in a
cheap plastic pitcher I picked up one day when it
was marked down to a dollar, and put the pitcher
in the fridge. Though it rarely lasts longer than
a day- especially if I am not the only one
drinking it- It will keep a good long while in the
fridge, maybe 2 weeks or so before becoming
questionable.'){:.displayleft}](http://i.imgur.com/FxcfTen.png)

_Lemons are better for You, but Lemon Juice is much cheaper._

##### Instructions #####

To start, bring 1.5 Qts of tap water to a boil. While waiting, add 1
Pt of cold water to a cup or bowl. Add Lemon Juice to cold water, and
Tea Bags to a 2 Qt glass or earthenware bowl.

Once boiling, add Tap Water to Tea Bags. Brew for 7 minutes (Iced tea
should be brewed about 180% normal time, to give it strong
flavor). Remove the Tea Bags, add Sugar, and stir until dissolved.

Add Lemon Water to the Sugared Tea. Bring to a bit over room
temperature, store in a pitcher in the freezer for about an hour.

##### My Thoughts #####

This is a simple formula for a very reliable beverage. You can
customize this many ways to suit a variety of tastes or needs, and can
easily emulate most flavors out on the market for much less than they
charge.

The difference is not so much that buying it to drink while You are
out is stupid, but if You can, it is much better to make it home.

Do it Yourself.

5 tea bags @ 100 / $5.00 = 0.25
1/2 C sugar @ 10lbs (24 C) / $4.98 = 0.11
2 Qt Water @ 1000 Gal / $5.05 = 0.26
1 Lemon @ 1 Units / $0.40 = 0.40

Price roughly $1.02, without energy costs.

!!! With Lemon Juice @ 1 qt / $1.29 and 3 tbsp = 1 Lemon,
lemon cost becomes $0.06, making pre energy costs flatten
to 0.68. !!!


Energy costs estimate: 0.18 / kWh (Average from sample bills on
internet, incl. supply and delivery)

1.5kW kettle * 0.25 hours = 0.375 kWh

0.375 kWh * $0.18 = 0.0675

Adding energy costs, about $0.93 a half gallon.

Assuming daily use, per quarter this adds roughly $6.08 to the
electric bill of a household.



Compare to price of Arizona or Wawa Tea:

Arizona: 2.78/gallon + (2.78 * 0.07) or (0.1946) or 0.20 tax =

         $2.98/gallon, $1.49 half gallon, or +$0.40 / half gallon.

Assuming daily consumption, this would be a difference of $50.40 per
quarter.

Wawa: usually on sale for 3 half gal/$5.00, meaning 1 = 1.6667,
or 1 half gal @ $1.67. Adding tax, this comes to

         $1.79 half gallon, or +0.70 / half gallon.

Assuming daily consumption, this would be a difference of $77 per
quarter.

Nutrition Facts:

Calories per half gallon: 17 + 387 + 2 = 406 kCal

Calories from Carbs: 2 + 387 + 14.79 = 403.79 kCal

Grams from Carbs: 0.71 + 99.98 + 5.41 = 106.10g

Calories from Fats: 1.02 = 1.02 kCal

Grams from Fats: 0 + 0 + 0.17 = 0.17g

Calories from Proteins: 1.7 = 1.7 kCal

Grams from Proteins: 0 + 0 + 0.64 = 0.64g
