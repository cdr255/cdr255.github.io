'Armagetron Advanced starts up and allows You to set
up a game in less than a minute. Very fast and easy
to learn.')

[Armagetron Advanced][armagetronad] is a modern tron-like game which
supports up to 16 simultaneous players. It supports many people
playing on one system, and many systems playing on one LAN. It runs on
__GNU/Linux__, __MS Windows__, and __Mac OSX__, If You happen to use
__0install__, it is also in that repository. It is Free, Libre, Open
Source software.

The basics of the game are simple: You ride around in a square room on
a tron bike, attempting to last longer than all of the other
players. Behind Your bike is a light trail, which is solid for all
intents and purposes. The default mode makes this light trail
permanent and of infinite length, making the game harder the longer it
goes on.

'During gameplay, the camera will follow You
smartly. There are only three movement controls:
left, right, and brake. There is a chat function,
but it is only really useful after You have
already died.')

You can change most of the settings, if You are the one who is running
the server: You can have the room be huge or tiny, the bikes be fast
or slow, light trails decay or be permanent, bots join or leave, teams
set up or broken, and even control the music which plays in the
background.

It falls flat for me in that, other than the built in scoring system,
there is very little in the terms of development over the course of a
night. It is very close to the original in terms of abstract
mechanics, and that leaves me wanting something more complex. But for
a social event, or a quick break from more complex games, I go to this
one first.

'With a large amount of players or bots, the
game can get quite hectic. The basic game is 10
rounds, and rarely takes more than 10 minutes,
especially with a decent number of people. Try
this game out today!')

It is an easy, lightweight game to set up, and is perfect for an
impromtu LAN Party.
