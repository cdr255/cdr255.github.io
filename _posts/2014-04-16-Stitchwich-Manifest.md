**tl;dr:** _What this site is, and who I am._

'This is a shot of yarn, in an almost food-like
composition. It shows the two necessities that
this blog is focused on addressing at this time:
Food and Clothing. Universal needs every human
being has. Artist was Chris Rodriguez, CC-BY-SA

There are certain things univerally needed by human beings in order to
live in this society. The two which came to my mind immediately were
food and clothes. This blog is meant to help deal with those needs
from a mostly DIY / low cost lifestyle perspective. On this blog, I
intend to record:

- Crochet Patterns I Use
- Recipes and Cooking Techniques I Use
- Other useful DIY Techniques I Use (especially those usable by most
  people without too much training)
- Shopping lists (and info about food) that I Use
- Maintenance techniques for various machines and items I Use 
- My own personal reflections as I go through life from this
  perspective

I am moving out in a few weeks. Content will likely pick up then, as I
will be running a household with two friends instead of living in
someone else's household. This blog is meant to simplify that
transition for me.

Do it Yourself.
