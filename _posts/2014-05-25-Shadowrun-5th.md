My Sunday Gaming Group recently switched from Pathfinder over to
Shadowrun (5th Edition).

We've had one character creation day, and it went well, though we are
having a second one today because of some absentees and for others to
finish up. It's also the time of year when getting everyone in the
same room seems to become difficult, so there is that as well.

My character is nearly finished, I just have to write out his [Character Detail Sheet](http://www.cdr255.com/content/games/Character-Detail-Sheet.doc) so that he is fully fleshed out. I've just now added a page for him on [my website](http://www.cdr255.com) if You would like to check his sheet out.

But I thought that I would talk a bit (briefly, don't worry) about
character creation in Shadowrun. It comes down to about 7 or 8 steps,
and though I lost access to my scratch file for Keith over there, I
wanted to at least delineate those steps here.

0. __Concept__

   You have to have a character concept (ie at least a bit of
   fluff) before You can make a character.
   
1. __Priorities__

   This appears to be the most difficult for new players to wrap their
   heads around, so I will take a few sentences to explain it a bit.

   Basically, there are 5 rankings: A, B, C, D, and E. A is the 'best'
   and E is the 'worst.' Calling them rankings instead of priorities
   helped me, as I grew up on jrpgs and other video games where You
   can have a character with a high ranking/level in one thing and a
   low ranking/level in another.

   You also have 5 parts to Your character: Metatype, Attributes,
   Skills, Resources, and Magic/Resonance. Now, the important part:

   __You need to assign each of those 5 parts a ranking, and can only
   use each ranking once.__

   Then, You use the table in the book to note what that gets Your
   character. That is pretty much it.
   
2. __Attributes and Special Attributes__
   
   Depends on two rankings: Your Metatype and Your Attributes.

   You spend Your Attribute points on the following attributes: __BOD,
   AGI, REA, STR, WIL, LOG, INT,__ and __CHA.__ Your special attribute
   points, on the other hand, go to: __EDG, MAG,__ and __RES__.

   Spend all of them; they cannot be saved.
   
3. __Qualities__

   If You have played Dnd or Pathfinder, these are like Feats and Flaws.

   You start with 25 Karma. You can spend exactly 25 Karma on positive
   qualities. You can also gain up to 25 Karma by taking negative
   qualities. You can __not__ spend more than 25 Karma on positive
   qualities. You also can __not__ gain more than 25 Karma by taking
   negative qualities.

   Do not feel like You have to use all of Your Karma, It is actually
   useful in step 6.
   
4. __Skills, Group Skills, and Knowledge Skills__

   This was the part which annoyed me the most. You have the two
   values from Your priority chosed for skill: Your normal skill
   points / Your group skill points. However, there is a third type of
   skill point which is hidden in the skill section of the text (page
   89, if You need a reference.)

   Every character gains __Knowledge Skill Points__ equal to (INT +
   LOG) x 2. This should really be stated better in the text, as our
   entire group nearly missed it. These points can only be spent on
   Knowledge Skills.

   Also, You get one language at the rank of 'N' for free.
   
5. __Resources__

   This is shopping. Spend money, get things. Only note I have is You
   need to spend to get under 5000 nuyen, or lose that money for no
   reason.
   
6. __Karma__

   This is the most fluid section. I would recommend talking to Your
   DM about it, or if You are the DM, reading the section in
   full. Basically, You can use Karma for a bunch of things,
   including: Familiars, Contacts, Skills, Magic, and more.

   Have fun.
   
7. __Finishing Up__

   There are some final calculations to make, as well as Your
   character details. Basic TTRPG stuff here. Hard work is done
   already.

And there You have it. A finished shadowrun character in 7 or 8
steps. Depending on how things go today, I may talk more about it in
the future as well.
