__tl;dr: A nice little one-pot Oat Dish for Breakfast.__

### Before You Get Started... ###

It is always a good idea to set aside the things You will need for a
dish before You begin to cook. I've broken this down into two lists,
*Items* and *Ingredients*, which are below.

__Items:__

* 1 Small Pot/Saucepan with lid
* 1 Cup Measure
* 2 Bowls
* 1 Spatula
* 1 Cup
* 1 Fork

__Ingredients:__

* 1/2 Cup of Rolled Oats
* 2 Tbsp of Romano Parmesian Cheese
* 1 Veggie Burger Patty
* 2 Eggs
* Garlic Powder
* Black Pepper
* Cayenne Pepper
* Salt
* Cooking Oil

This recipe takes about *20-30 minutes* to complete, due to the amount
of prep. If You are quick, You could probably cut it down to around *15
minutes*, start to finish.

### The Main Course (Of Instructions) ###

1. Put the Pan on Medium-High Heat. Spray the patty with cooking oil
   (or, if You are using non-spray oil, brush each side of it with
   oil), and put it in the pan. There will still be some sticking; the
   oil is there to help it cook more evenly.

2. Making sure to flip the patty regularly, heat it all of the way
   through. When it begins to lose cohesion and fall apart, break it
   into small chunks and push them to one side of the pan, removing it
   from heat.

3. Separate the egg whites from the yolks using Your preferred method,
   saving the yolks in the cup, and the whites in one of the two
   bowls. Add spices to the whites and whisk them with a fork. Return
   the pan to the heat.

4. Add a small amount of oil to the bare part of the pan, and then add
   the egg whites. While they begin to cook, quickly clean the bowl
   the yolks were just in; You will need it again soon.

5. Scramble the entire contents of the pan, making sure everything is
   once again heated through. Once done, transfer the contents of the
   pan to Your newly cleaned bowl. It is okay if some small bits are
   still stuck to the pan, but attempt to get as much out as possible.

6. Add the water to the pan, raise the heat, and cover it until the
   water comes to a rolling boil. Add the oats. Cook for 5 minutes,
   stirring once every minute.

7. When finished, add the bowl of eggs and patty to the pan, and then
   add some cheese on top. Stir, cover, and remove from heat for 3
   minutes.

8. Transfer the contents of the pan back into the same bowl as
   before. Sprinkle with salt and enjoy.


### Clean Up ###

As You can see, there is a very small amount of clean up to be
had. Obviously something needs to be done about the egg yolks (ice
cream, medieval cookery, or the like), but You really only have 5
minutes of clean up here... And the water-bowl can just be dried and
put away.

### Nutritional Information ###

### Closing Remarks ###

If You have read this far, bravo. I only wish I had some way to reward
You. But Maybe this is enough: Thank You very much for Your interest
and Your time. I hope to see You again soon. Comments are always appreciated!
