'Not too too much to say for this one, but I will say that this is our
current mascot! She doesn't have a name yet, but will soon. Also, I
have to say that yes, this is the only post which will deal with why
we have the name Tumbling Owl.'){:.display}](http://imgur.com/OHhsz7m.png)

This is mostly a test post to see how well this layout will work in
practice, but I will say a few things.

- Owls are pretty cool

- I will be posting small, short posts here a lot

- Games are fun, and so are stories

- I want to hear from You on the things I post here

- An owl rolling around is pretty cute.

- Other than this post, I will never say what the topic of this blog
  is.

Let's see.
