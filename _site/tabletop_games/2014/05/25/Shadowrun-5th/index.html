    <h1>Sunday Tabletop #0001 - Shadowrun Character Creation</h1>

  </header>

  <article class="post-content">
  <p><strong>Word Count: ~718, Estimated Reading Time: About 3 Minutes, 36 Seconds.</strong></p>

<p>My Sunday Gaming Group recently switched from Pathfinder over to
Shadowrun (5th Edition).</p>

<p>We’ve had one character creation day, and it went well, though we are
having a second one today because of some absentees and for others to
finish up. It’s also the time of year when getting everyone in the
same room seems to become difficult, so there is that as well.</p>

<p>My character is nearly finished, I just have to write out his <a href="http://www.cdr255.com/content/games/Character-Detail-Sheet.doc">Character Detail Sheet</a> so that he is fully fleshed out. I’ve just now added a page for him on <a href="http://www.cdr255.com">my website</a> if You would like to check his sheet out.</p>

<p>But I thought that I would talk a bit (briefly, don’t worry) about
character creation in Shadowrun. It comes down to about 7 or 8 steps,
and though I lost access to my scratch file for Keith over there, I
wanted to at least delineate those steps here.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Concept</strong></p>

    <p>You have to have a character concept (ie at least a bit of
fluff) before You can make a character.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Priorities</strong></p>

    <p>This appears to be the most difficult for new players to wrap their
heads around, so I will take a few sentences to explain it a bit.</p>

    <p>Basically, there are 5 rankings: A, B, C, D, and E. A is the ‘best’
and E is the ‘worst.’ Calling them rankings instead of priorities
helped me, as I grew up on jrpgs and other video games where You
can have a character with a high ranking/level in one thing and a
low ranking/level in another.</p>

    <p>You also have 5 parts to Your character: Metatype, Attributes,
Skills, Resources, and Magic/Resonance. Now, the important part:</p>

    <p><strong>You need to assign each of those 5 parts a ranking, and can only
use each ranking once.</strong></p>

    <p>Then, You use the table in the book to note what that gets Your
character. That is pretty much it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Attributes and Special Attributes</strong></p>

    <p>Depends on two rankings: Your Metatype and Your Attributes.</p>

    <p>You spend Your Attribute points on the following attributes: <strong>BOD,
AGI, REA, STR, WIL, LOG, INT,</strong> and <strong>CHA.</strong> Your special attribute
points, on the other hand, go to: <strong>EDG, MAG,</strong> and <strong>RES</strong>.</p>

    <p>Spend all of them; they cannot be saved.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Qualities</strong></p>

    <p>If You have played Dnd or Pathfinder, these are like Feats and Flaws.</p>

    <p>You start with 25 Karma. You can spend exactly 25 Karma on positive
qualities. You can also gain up to 25 Karma by taking negative
qualities. You can <strong>not</strong> spend more than 25 Karma on positive
qualities. You also can <strong>not</strong> gain more than 25 Karma by taking
negative qualities.</p>

    <p>Do not feel like You have to use all of Your Karma, It is actually
useful in step 6.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Skills, Group Skills, and Knowledge Skills</strong></p>

    <p>This was the part which annoyed me the most. You have the two
values from Your priority chosed for skill: Your normal skill
points / Your group skill points. However, there is a third type of
skill point which is hidden in the skill section of the text (page
89, if You need a reference.)</p>

    <p>Every character gains <strong>Knowledge Skill Points</strong> equal to (INT +
LOG) x 2. This should really be stated better in the text, as our
entire group nearly missed it. These points can only be spent on
Knowledge Skills.</p>

    <p>Also, You get one language at the rank of ‘N’ for free.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Resources</strong></p>

    <p>This is shopping. Spend money, get things. Only note I have is You
need to spend to get under 5000 nuyen, or lose that money for no
reason.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Karma</strong></p>

    <p>This is the most fluid section. I would recommend talking to Your
DM about it, or if You are the DM, reading the section in
full. Basically, You can use Karma for a bunch of things,
including: Familiars, Contacts, Skills, Magic, and more.</p>

    <p>Have fun.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Finishing Up</strong></p>

    <p>There are some final calculations to make, as well as Your
character details. Basic TTRPG stuff here. Hard work is done
already.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>And there You have it. A finished shadowrun character in 7 or 8
steps. Depending on how things go today, I may talk more about it in
the future as well.</p>
