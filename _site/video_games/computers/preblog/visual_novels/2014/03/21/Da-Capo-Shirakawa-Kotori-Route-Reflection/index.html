  <article class="post-content">
  <p><strong>663 words. Estimated Reading Time: 3 Minutes, 18 Seconds.</strong></p>

<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> <em>I just finished Kotori’s Route in Da Capo I!</em></p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/gVZcn06.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/gVZcn06.png" alt="The Starting Screen of Da Capo" title="Da Capo is a great visual novel by the company Circus. It came out a
while ago, and had a few pretty bad [IMHO] Anime adaptations, but it
still hits me pretty close to home in terms of situation and
emotions. The H Scenes seem kinda tacked on at times, though I have
seen much worse. I personally give it an 8/10." class="displayleft" /></a></p>

<p>So, I just finished playing through Shirakawa Kotori’s route in <em>Da
Capo</em>. I had a good time, and though I was able to play through the
whole thing in a little more than a day, I found a lot of the moments
to be very memorable. This isn’t a spoiler blog, though, so I won’t go
into too many specifics.</p>

<p>A major theme which carries through her entire route is the theme of
<em>misunderstanding</em>. Just about everyone, including You, misunderstands
each other in this storyline… Even little things (Like talking on
the telephone) are made into relatable and memorable events based on
this motif. And dealing with that is a large part of the story, for
better or for worse.</p>

<p>And, needless to say, there are a few ways to get the worser endings.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/ZrBCFwJ.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ZrBCFwJ.png" alt="Shirakawa Kotori" title="Shirakawa Kotori is a very popular girl in our school, who suffers
from having people expect a lot from her no matter what she is
doing. Her story is well written, has a few good twists in it, and
altogether was a nice and memorable experience." class="displayright" /></a></p>

<p>Another theme present throughout Kotori’s route is being true to
Yourself. This is exemplified in Your character’s choices in regards
to family, friends, and even his own education. There is a lot of
growing up to do along this storyline, and experiencing that again
without feeling like the game is out of touch with reality was a
joy. All in all, a very good experience.</p>

<p>Kotori herself reminds me of a few people I used to know. Perhaps that
is why I find her to be so relatable… It is a very realistic set of
emotions that she carries throughout the story, and she is able to
present them in such a way that, given the circumstances, I can
completely believe that these emotions are genuine.</p>

<p>And hey, she is introduced at the beginning of the game as a very
popular person… which (though that is not exactly my case now) I can
say from experience builds up a lot of superficial
relationships. Superficial relationships are (spoiler alert) not very
gratifying IRL or to You or Kotori.</p>

<p><a href="http://i.imgur.com/pbsc0ia.png"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/pbsc0ia.png" alt="Shirakawa Kotori Ending" title="I've mentioned in the past that my favorite route in this game is
Mako. However, this was a very enjoyable story for a few reasons: I
could relate a lot with the emotions of the main character, especially
in regard to misunderstanding my sigificant other. I liked how some of
the most memorable moments in the game were sharing simple pleasures
like ice cream or singing. And, in the end, I could relate a lot to
Kotori and her issues communicating with people. Definitely not a weak
route in this game." class="displayleft" /></a></p>

<p>All in all, I had quite a good time with this. There were only a few
<em>Gotcha!</em> moments in the choices, and because of this I can easily
recommend Da Capo and Kotori’s route to those looking to do a “real
life” playthrough of a Visual Novel. Anyone who had a middle or high
school romance which survived (or died) due to communication and self
discovery will enjoy this route. I certainly did. And in regard to how
well is stacks up to Your expectations…</p>

<p>Let’s see.</p>
