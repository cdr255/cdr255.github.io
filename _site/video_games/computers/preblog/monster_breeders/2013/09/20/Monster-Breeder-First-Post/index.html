  <p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/9w1StRM.png" alt="Pokemon Concept Art with Red, Blue, and Green" title="This concept art is from the series of Pok&eacute;mon. It depicts
 the three starter creatures, and the three original characters which
 were conceptualized before the first game." class="left" /></p>

<p><strong>tl;dr</strong> - Monster Breeders are RPGs where the main character raises
  at least one creature as a main part of the game. There’s a partial
  list below.</p>

<h3 id="what-is-the-monster-breeder-blog">What is the Monster Breeder Blog?</h3>
<p>Well, one of my favorite kinds of video games to play is the “Monster
Breeder RPG.” These are games that, as a core concept, allow the
player to raise a team of creatures, usually which grow over time, in
order to do battle or perform in some way. </p>

<p>Many people have played one of the most popular (and one of the first)
games in this subgenre, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokemon" title="Fun Fact: Pokemon was originally called Capumon, but changed to be less commercial sounding."><strong>Pokémon</strong></a> (or <strong>Pocket
Monsters</strong>), at least at one point in their lives. This is the kind of
game I am talking about here: Creatures that grow and learn as the
game goes on.</p>

<p>Unfortunately (and fortunately, for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Freak" title="Fun Fact: Game Freak actually published two (nonpokemon) games for the Sega Genesis!">Game Freak</a>), while
there is a whole world of games in this very often overlooked genre,
most of them forever live in the shadow of <strong>Pokémon</strong>, being
regarded as “Clones,” “Ripoffs,” or “Ghetto <strong>Pokémon</strong>.”</p>

<p>As this is one of my favorite genres of games (and as I am always
looking for new ways to interact with a relatively small and
overlooked genre) I have decided to start a blog about them. This is
that Blog.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/JLNKSNs.jpg" alt="Digimon Sketch - Gabumon" title="This is a
 sketch of one of the main creatures in the Digimon Mythos,
 Gabumon. He and Agumon were the two starters of the first &quot;Digimon
 World&quot; Game." class="right" /></p>

<h3 id="what-are-some-examples-of-monster-breeder-games">What are some examples of Monster Breeder Games?</h3>
<p>Here is a (very partial, off-the-top-of-my-head) list of some of the
more memorable games which will fall into this site’s purview:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pokemon" title="Fun Fact: Pokemon was originally called Capumon, but changed to be less commercial sounding."><strong>Pokémon</strong></a> - Pocket Monsters, the game that all
other Monster Breeders are compared to. Created by

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo" title="Fun Fact: The first game published by Nintendo was a card game called Hanafuda.">Nintendo</a> (and if You haven’t heard of <strong>Pokémon</strong>,
I don’t know how You found Your way here…).</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digimon" title="Fun Fact: Digimon Started as a Virtual Pet, sort of like a Boy's version of the Tamagotchi."><strong>Digimon</strong></a> - Digital Monsters, the (as I recall) second
most popular Monster Breeding Franchise from the early days. Created
by “<a href="http://digimon.wikia.com/wiki/Akiyoshi_Hongo" title="Fun Fact: Nothing is known about this man. Rumor says the name may be a portmanteau of two different people.">Akiyoshi Hongo</a>,” <a href="http://wikimon.net/WiZ_Inc." title="Fun Fact: Also responsible for the Tamogatchi!">Wiz Inc.</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandai" title="Fun Fact: Now a part of Namco.">Bandai</a>, and

Playstation where You could generate monsters by inserting different
discs into the system. Created by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tecmo_Koei" title="Fun Fact: Also made Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive.">Tecmo Koei</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jade_Cocoon" title="Fun Fact: Character Design done by Studio Ghibli!"><strong>Jade Cocoon</strong></a> - The Legend of Tamamayu, just about my
favorite console game of all time. Definitely in my top 5. Had one
sequel, both playstation exclusives. Created by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genki_%28company%29" title="Fun Fact: This company is mostly known for its racing games, mostly Shutoukou Battle">Genki</a> and

    <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_Pengel:_The_Quest_for_Color" title="Fun Fact: Also Collaborated with Studio Ghibli."><strong>Magic Pengel</strong></a> - The Quest for Color, A very much
overlooked game for the ps2. Has one oddly named sequel. Created by
<strong>Garakuda Studio</strong> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taito_Corporation" title="Fun Fact: This company is (one of my favorites ever, but also) well known for their amazing arcade games like Bubble Bobble and Space Invaders.">Taito Corporation</a>, published in the
US by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agetec" title="Fun Fact: Also brought the cult hits 'Cookie and Cream' and 'RPG Maker' to the US.">Agetec</a>.</p>

</ul>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/tsBye0l.png" alt="Monster Rancher - March of the Tigers Image" title="This is a screencap of the opening of Monster Rancher's Anime,
 depicting many different species of the same type, the Tiger
 Monster. Depicted are the TigerxTiger [blue], TigerxPixie [pink],
 TigerxZuum [green], and TigerxGolem [grey]." class="center" /></p>

<h3 id="what-exactly-do-you-plan-on-talking-about-on-this-blog">What exactly do You plan on talking about on this Blog?</h3>
<p>First off, I want to give each and every game I own in this genre a
good-faith review. There is not enough of a murmur about some of these
games on the net, so I would like to add my mumbling to the mix.</p>

<p>Secondly, I want to talk about news concerning both the genre and the
series themselves, as well as anything else that may well impact
it. (I am crossing my fingers indefinitely for a <strong>Jade Cocoon</strong> Movie
or Anime).</p>

<p>Thirdly, I want to Overthink and Overanalyse as many parts of these
games as I can. Part of the culture of these games is their immersive
universes, which allow for a degree of subtlety only rivaled by other
RPGs, and even then not all of them. I want to consider and talk about
the little things.</p>

<p>Fourthly, I want to compare and contrast the gaming mechanics of each
game I mention (eventually, very hard work). This is to give me and
other game designers perhaps a clearer view of what has and has not
worked in the past, and to reveal the seamy underside of the games to
those who wish to view it.</p>

<p>Finally, I just want to create and gather more content around these
games and their fanbases. I want to keep these games alive, well past
their last printings.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/38eEeBD.jpg" alt="Jade Cocoon - Levant by a Tree" title="This
 is the cover to the Official Soundtrack of Jade Cocoon 1. It shows
 the Main Character, Levant, sitting in the Forest... Probably the
 Spider Forest." class="left" /></p>

<h3 id="anything-else">Anything Else?</h3>
<p>Well, I am going to try my best to keep this blog on topic as much as
possible… but I make no promises in that regard. I am very good at
relating things, and even tangental relationships are good enough for
this blog, so yeah, expect a wide variety of content.</p>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ketGbYb.jpg" alt="Magic Pengel - OST" title="This is the
 cover of the OST to Magic Pengel. It shows many of the main
 characters in the game." class="right" /></p>

Comments section below, or in my <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#099;&#100;&#114;&#050;&#053;&#053;&#064;&#103;&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;" title="I respond fairly quickly, and I don't bite!">inbox</a>. Thanks for reading
