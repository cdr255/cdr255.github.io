        <title>Sunday Tabletop #0001 - Shadowrun Character Creation</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Word Count: ~718, Estimated Reading Time: About 3 Minutes, 36 Seconds.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My Sunday Gaming Group recently switched from Pathfinder over to
Shadowrun (5th Edition).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve had one character creation day, and it went well, though we are
having a second one today because of some absentees and for others to
finish up. It’s also the time of year when getting everyone in the
same room seems to become difficult, so there is that as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My character is nearly finished, I just have to write out his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cdr255.com/content/games/Character-Detail-Sheet.doc&quot;&gt;Character Detail Sheet&lt;/a&gt; so that he is fully fleshed out. I’ve just now added a page for him on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cdr255.com&quot;&gt;my website&lt;/a&gt; if You would like to check his sheet out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I thought that I would talk a bit (briefly, don’t worry) about
character creation in Shadowrun. It comes down to about 7 or 8 steps,
and though I lost access to my scratch file for Keith over there, I
wanted to at least delineate those steps here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Concept&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;You have to have a character concept (ie at least a bit of
fluff) before You can make a character.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Priorities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This appears to be the most difficult for new players to wrap their
heads around, so I will take a few sentences to explain it a bit.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Basically, there are 5 rankings: A, B, C, D, and E. A is the ‘best’
and E is the ‘worst.’ Calling them rankings instead of priorities
helped me, as I grew up on jrpgs and other video games where You
can have a character with a high ranking/level in one thing and a
low ranking/level in another.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;You also have 5 parts to Your character: Metatype, Attributes,
Skills, Resources, and Magic/Resonance. Now, the important part:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You need to assign each of those 5 parts a ranking, and can only
use each ranking once.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Then, You use the table in the book to note what that gets Your
character. That is pretty much it.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Attributes and Special Attributes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Depends on two rankings: Your Metatype and Your Attributes.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;You spend Your Attribute points on the following attributes: &lt;strong&gt;BOD,
AGI, REA, STR, WIL, LOG, INT,&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;CHA.&lt;/strong&gt; Your special attribute
points, on the other hand, go to: &lt;strong&gt;EDG, MAG,&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;RES&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Spend all of them; they cannot be saved.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Qualities&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;If You have played Dnd or Pathfinder, these are like Feats and Flaws.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;You start with 25 Karma. You can spend exactly 25 Karma on positive
qualities. You can also gain up to 25 Karma by taking negative
qualities. You can &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; spend more than 25 Karma on positive
qualities. You also can &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; gain more than 25 Karma by taking
negative qualities.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Do not feel like You have to use all of Your Karma, It is actually
useful in step 6.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skills, Group Skills, and Knowledge Skills&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This was the part which annoyed me the most. You have the two
values from Your priority chosed for skill: Your normal skill
points / Your group skill points. However, there is a third type of
skill point which is hidden in the skill section of the text (page
89, if You need a reference.)&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Every character gains &lt;strong&gt;Knowledge Skill Points&lt;/strong&gt; equal to (INT +
LOG) x 2. This should really be stated better in the text, as our
entire group nearly missed it. These points can only be spent on
Knowledge Skills.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Also, You get one language at the rank of ‘N’ for free.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resources&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is shopping. Spend money, get things. Only note I have is You
need to spend to get under 5000 nuyen, or lose that money for no
reason.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Karma&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;This is the most fluid section. I would recommend talking to Your
DM about it, or if You are the DM, reading the section in
full. Basically, You can use Karma for a bunch of things,
including: Familiars, Contacts, Skills, Magic, and more.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Have fun.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finishing Up&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;There are some final calculations to make, as well as Your
character details. Basic TTRPG stuff here. Hard work is done
already.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And there You have it. A finished shadowrun character in 7 or 8
steps. Depending on how things go today, I may talk more about it in
the future as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

        <title>Monday Multiplayer #0001 - Armagetron Advanced</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Word Count: ~267, Estimated Reading Time: About 1 Minute, 20 Seconds.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/oPNXpRn.png&quot; alt=&quot;Start Screen&quot; title=&quot;Armagetron Advanced starts up and allows You to set
up a game in less than a minute. Very fast and easy
to learn.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[Armagetron Advanced][armagetronad] is a modern tron-like game which
supports up to 16 simultaneous players. It supports many people
playing on one system, and many systems playing on one LAN. It runs on
&lt;strong&gt;GNU/Linux&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;MS Windows&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;Mac OSX&lt;/strong&gt;, If You happen to use
&lt;strong&gt;0install&lt;/strong&gt;, it is also in that repository. It is Free, Libre, Open
Source software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The basics of the game are simple: You ride around in a square room on
a tron bike, attempting to last longer than all of the other
players. Behind Your bike is a light trail, which is solid for all
intents and purposes. The default mode makes this light trail
permanent and of infinite length, making the game harder the longer it
goes on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/r4q8IxL.png&quot; alt=&quot;Screenshot During Gameplay&quot; title=&quot;During gameplay, the camera will follow You
smartly. There are only three movement controls:
left, right, and brake. There is a chat function,
but it is only really useful after You have
already died.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can change most of the settings, if You are the one who is running
the server: You can have the room be huge or tiny, the bikes be fast
or slow, light trails decay or be permanent, bots join or leave, teams
set up or broken, and even control the music which plays in the
background.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It falls flat for me in that, other than the built in scoring system,
there is very little in the terms of development over the course of a
night. It is very close to the original in terms of abstract
mechanics, and that leaves me wanting something more complex. But for
a social event, or a quick break from more complex games, I go to this
one first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/hoMyvTv.png&quot; alt=&quot;Watching the Chaos&quot; title=&quot;With a large amount of players or bots, the
game can get quite hectic. The basic game is 10
rounds, and rarely takes more than 10 minutes,
especially with a decent number of people. Try
this game out today!&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is an easy, lightweight game to set up, and is perfect for an
impromtu LAN Party.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To hear what this sounds like, I have a MIDI file available &lt;a href=&quot;/assets/midi/bransle-pinagay.midi&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To perform this dance, You need a line or a circle of dancers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Section A:  1  - 4    Double left,
            5         Kick left.
            6  - 9    Double left,
            10 - 12   Kick left, right, left.
            
Section B:  13 - 16   Double left,
            17 - 20   Double right.
            21 - 24   Double left,
            25 - 28   Double right.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

        <title>Jekyll and Hyde: Moving from Blogger to Jekyll</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been blogging and maintaining personal websites for years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My most recent foray has been, largely, a success: I have had 8
different blogs hosted by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blogger.com/&quot; title=&quot;Google&#39;s Blogging Service.&quot;&gt;Blogger&lt;/a&gt; over the last two
years. However, the downsides to this are twofold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, and foremost: I have &lt;strong&gt;Eight&lt;/strong&gt; blogs. Content on all of them
has been a trickle, mostly because I tend to focus on updating one or
two of them instead of each one in succession. This balkanization of
my blogging has been a big detrement to me for a while, so I recently
decided that it might be smart to go down to one blog only… at least
for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second… I write all of my posts using the markup language
&lt;a href=&quot;kramdown.gettalong.org/&quot; title=&quot;My personal markup language of choice.&quot;&gt;kramdown&lt;/a&gt; (which is really a dialect of
[markdown][md]). Blogger supports posts written in only two formats:
HTML, and their own “Rich Text Editor.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What this means for me is that I have to compile my posts on my own
computer before uploading them to the web. So, why put up with some of
the annoyances of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.blogger.com/&quot; title=&quot;Google&#39;s Blogging Service.&quot;&gt;Blogger&lt;/a&gt; if I am doing static site
generation anyway?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, I chose to move to &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com&quot; title=&quot;This whole site is rendered with Jekyll.&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;. It was quite a process,
but that is a different post. I am very happy with it so far, and will
update more on it as I begin to migrate everything over to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hope it all goes smoothly from here on out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Christopher&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Welcome to Jekyll!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;You’ll find this post in your &lt;code&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the &lt;code&gt;-w&lt;/code&gt; switch) to see your changes!
To add new posts, simply add a file in the &lt;code&gt;_posts&lt;/code&gt; directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&#39;Tom&#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints &#39;Hi, Tom&#39; to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out the &lt;a href=&quot;http://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll docs&lt;/a&gt; for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll&quot;&gt;Jekyll’s GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;A quick and easy sugar drink with a nice amount of
  caffeine. Perfect for getting me through the day, even if the day is
  opposed to the idea.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/FxcfTen.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/FxcfTen.png&quot; alt=&quot;A Pitcher of Iced Tea&quot; title=&quot;I store the finished product described here in a
cheap plastic pitcher I picked up one day when it
was marked down to a dollar, and put the pitcher
in the fridge. Though it rarely lasts longer than
a day- especially if I am not the only one
drinking it- It will keep a good long while in the
fridge, maybe 2 weeks or so before becoming
questionable.&quot; class=&quot;displayleft&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;ingredients&quot;&gt;Ingredients&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;table&gt;

      &lt;td&gt;B       :&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lemons are better for You, but Lemon Juice is much cheaper.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;instructions&quot;&gt;Instructions&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To start, bring 1.5 Qts of tap water to a boil. While waiting, add 1
Pt of cold water to a cup or bowl. Add Lemon Juice to cold water, and
Tea Bags to a 2 Qt glass or earthenware bowl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once boiling, add Tap Water to Tea Bags. Brew for 7 minutes (Iced tea
should be brewed about 180% normal time, to give it strong
flavor). Remove the Tea Bags, add Sugar, and stir until dissolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Add Lemon Water to the Sugared Tea. Bring to a bit over room
temperature, store in a pitcher in the freezer for about an hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;comparison&quot;&gt;Comparison&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Common Option&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Cost per Unit (1/2 Gal)&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Diff per Unit (Opt A)&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Diff per Unit (Opt B)&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Arizona&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$1.49&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;+$0.40&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;+$0.74&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Wawa&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;$1.79&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;+$0.70&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;+$1.04&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h5 id=&quot;my-thoughts&quot;&gt;My Thoughts&lt;/h5&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a simple formula for a very reliable beverage. You can
customize this many ways to suit a variety of tastes or needs, and can
easily emulate most flavors out on the market for much less than they

&lt;p&gt;The difference is not so much that buying it to drink while You are
out is stupid, but if You can, it is much better to make it home.&lt;/p&gt;

2 Qt Water @ 1000 Gal / $5.05 = 0.26
1 Lemon @ 1 Units / $0.40 = 0.40

Price roughly $1.02, without energy costs.

!!! With Lemon Juice @ 1 qt / $1.29 and 3 tbsp = 1 Lemon,
lemon cost becomes $0.06, making pre energy costs flatten
to 0.68. !!!


Energy costs estimate: 0.18 / kWh (Average from sample bills on
internet, incl. supply and delivery)

1.5kW kettle * 0.25 hours = 0.375 kWh

0.375 kWh * $0.18 = 0.0675

Adding energy costs, about $0.93 a half gallon.

Assuming daily use, per quarter this adds roughly $6.08 to the
electric bill of a household.



Compare to price of Arizona or Wawa Tea:

Arizona: 2.78/gallon + (2.78 * 0.07) or (0.1946) or 0.20 tax =

         $2.98/gallon, $1.49 half gallon, or +$0.40 / half gallon.

Assuming daily consumption, this would be a difference of $50.40 per
quarter.

Wawa: usually on sale for 3 half gal/$5.00, meaning 1 = 1.6667,
or 1 half gal @ $1.67. Adding tax, this comes to

         $1.79 half gallon, or +0.70 / half gallon.

Assuming daily consumption, this would be a difference of $77 per

        <title>Beat the Main story of Ultimate Ninja Storm 3!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1149 Words. Estimated Reading Time: 5 Minutes, 45 Seconds.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 Full Burst is a
  fighting game, and may just be my favorite fighting game in the last
  5 years..&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/9A8UdCx.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/9A8UdCx.png&quot; alt=&quot;NSUNS3FB Title Screen&quot; title=&quot;A lot of
people will not even consider this game because it has ties to the
Naruto Franchise. It&#39;s a shame, because of how well done and tightly
made this game is. If You are on the fence about playing this game
just because it has the Naruto name all over it, I implore You to just
give it a shot. You will not be
disappointed.&quot; class=&quot;displayleft&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve just recently completed my first run through of the main story of
this game, &lt;em&gt;Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 Full Burst&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Long title, I know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I have to say that this game is probably my favorite fighting
game of the last 5 years. It is innovative in a few crucial ways while
not sacrificing accessibility or gameplay, and it does it all in a
very tight and engaging package.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has a large amount of characters which all play differently, and
the standard game is played with one main and two supporting
characters, allowing for a very large amount of versus
matchups. Characters has references to the story worked into the
gameplay itself, and not just into the story of the game… As in, a
character who is slow plays slow, a character who focuses on items or
melee is designed to be focused on that, and every character has a
mode where they will break away from the way most other characters
play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/Lbsv6e6.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/Lbsv6e6.png&quot; alt=&quot;Example of Combat Screen&quot; title=&quot;It is kinda hard to get a good screenshot of the combat of this game
while You are fighting, especially since the game is played with a
controller. I&#39;ll be talking about the game again on here, and by then
I will hopefully have a better screenshot to use... I&#39;ll have some
friends over to play while I work the keyboard. Should be good.&quot; class=&quot;displayright&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To digress for a second: Yes, it is a Naruto product. And no, &lt;em&gt;even if
You are not a fan of the series&lt;/em&gt;, it does not suck. No familiarity
with the story is needed to enjoy the game, as any needed backstory is
well represented within it. You will not be at a true disadvantage
versus someone really interested in the series, provided You play the
game enough to learn the rules and characters &lt;em&gt;as You would have to do
with any other fighting game&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fights are done in an arena style battlefield with a dynamic
camera. For 1 vs 1 battles (all versus matches and most story matches)
the camera works absolutely wonderfully. There are a few points in the
story when You fight “6 vs 2” battles (which is in quotes because it
is really 6 vs 1 + 1 support) or have beat’em up style dungeons to
walk through. The camera isn’t &lt;em&gt;horrible&lt;/em&gt; then, but You may have to
use that right stick more often in these few segments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/ItdCrBf.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/ItdCrBf.png&quot; alt=&quot;Combat Still 2&quot; title=&quot;An interesting facet of the battle system in this game, the cut scene
attacks [Jutsus, Throws, and Team Attacks] break up the monotony on
screen. They are easily blockable, easily dodgeable, take a lot of
energy and in no way are overpowered, which makes the fact that they
&amp;quot;pause the game&amp;quot; for a few seconds much more forgivable. Also, it is
really nice to see big moves from the show used in the game in a fair
way. Maybe that is a personal point, but I AM the author here.&quot; class=&quot;displayleft&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As for the combat itself: Instead of a combo-based move list like many
games in the fighting genre, this game created a large amount of
different kinds of commands. This makes for less memorization of combos
(Ex. &lt;em&gt;Quarter Circle Forward, A, Down, Back, B&lt;/em&gt;) and more a
memorization of abilities (Ex. &lt;em&gt;The Second Mizukage has many good
projectile attacks, and if he is cornered should back away as soon as
possible&lt;/em&gt;). However, this is different from most fighting games, so I
will clarify a few things about the control: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can still do a minimum of three melee combo strings per character,
but You can also: “throw” enemies, which really results in a move
which throws the enemy away from You; use two different kinds of
special move (Jutsu) which, provided they hit the enemy, play out in a
cutscene; throw projectiles which will stop an enemy for a split
second, breaking their commands or wasting their abilities; call upon
support from one of two team mates, who will either continue a combo
for You, hit an enemy with a special move, or (provided You have
filled a certain bar) gang up on Your enemy in a high-damage cutscene
where You all three juggle Your opponent, finishing with Your
strongest single move; Use three dimensional movement to dance around
the battlefield, able to dodge most attacks but unable to really do
damage, as a way to change the distance between You and Your opponent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/RijifLt.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/RijifLt.png&quot; alt=&quot;Legend vs Hero Concept&quot; title=&quot;One of the coolest aspects of this specific entry in this series is
this, the system of Legend vs. Hero that it has. Basically, You can
choose at certain points to take one of two choices [called an
Ultimate Decision in game] which will change the conditions
[and cutscenes] for the coming battle. There are also two different
sets of items in the game, which You can only use to support one of
the two choices. Pretty deep for a fighting game, and allows for a lot of
interesting choices.&quot; class=&quot;displayright&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are more commands, but this is already really long, so I’ll move
on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The story is decent, though if You &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; cannot stand Naruto, then
every story cutscene is skippable, and will not cause the game to be
unplayable. It is worked into the game very well, and I can easily
say I would play through it again: They have a few very interestingly
different situations which occurred in the story, and they were both
challenging and fun. Then, there is the Legend vs Hero system,
described in this image. Just, a lot of depth for a fighting game,
story wise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the main game is complete, You are given free reign to walk
around and engage people in the beautifully rendered 3D world. This is
where I currently am, and so I’d better get to completing it, so I can
talk about it too. I hope it doesn’t take me too too long!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

        <title>[Dragon Breed] is Awesome!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;730 words. Estimated Reading Time: 3 Minutes, 39 Seconds.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Dragon Breed is a shooter from IREM, which runs fine under
  current versions of MAME. It is hard and different, and I like it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/FRWgMt3.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/FRWgMt3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Dragon Breed Title Screen&quot; title=&quot;I recently was looking for some nice, challenging shooter titles,
since my game library is severly lacking in those[aside from Darius]
and that was unacceptable to me. Dragon Breed is different from normal
shooters in a different way than Darius, and is very satisfying to
make progress in. This title screen doesn&#39;t really do it justice, but
it does get the name out there, and I guess IREM thought it
represented their product fairly well... so, here ya go.&quot; class=&quot;displayleft&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of CAR (the three main needs which are satisfied by gaming:
Competence, Autonomy, and
Relatedness. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MyUC_28HIvA&quot; title=&quot;Game Theory did this gaming theory justice in their 100M subscriber special. Very nice overview of the topic. &quot;&gt;Good Video on the subject here&lt;/a&gt;) some of the best
representations of high &lt;em&gt;Competence&lt;/em&gt; gaming are the shooter games
(also called shoot’em ups or shmups).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have always had a fondness for shooters; one of my first memories in
video games was a game called &lt;em&gt;Stargunner&lt;/em&gt;, published by
Apogee. However, my current library was lacking a strong
representation of these games… so I went looking for new ones
recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found &lt;em&gt;Dragon Breed&lt;/em&gt;.
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/LOcemLu.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/LOcemLu.png&quot; alt=&quot;Dragon Breed Action Image&quot; title=&quot;This image is rather tame, but shows the difference between the
dragon [which is invincible] and Your character [which is extremely
vulnerable] very well. While it is true that having this huge
invincible wall around You makes certain situations easier, the
designers really took advantage of that benefit and made the enemies
that much more accurate towards Your very vulnerable character. It is
surprisingly hard to protect this little guy, and doing so feels both
rewarding and intense.&quot; class=&quot;displayright&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dragon Breed, by IREM, is a horizontal shooter which has a major
difference from most other shooters in that &lt;em&gt;You are riding a large,
invincible dragon&lt;/em&gt; instead of being in some kind of ship. This makes
Your own hitbox relatively small and well-protected versus most other
games, and at first glance, You may think that this makes it too easy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that is the opposite of the truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game is designed to mitigate this invincibility by making the
enemies aware of this. The enemies will never directly attack the
dragon, instead shooting directly for You. This makes the game
interesting, as You can block shots with the dragon, but rarely will a
shot be &lt;em&gt;accidently&lt;/em&gt; blocked because of the way it was shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And yeah, You die a lot in this game.
&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/zqoTVwh.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/zqoTVwh.png&quot; alt=&quot;Dragon Breed Dragon Birth&quot; title=&quot;It was difficult for me to get a good shot of this, so instead I went
for a cool simple image and I&#39;ll tell You here instead[Don&#39;t tell anyone
I cheated, kay?]. The opening cutscene of this game is Your character
walking along a cliff, taking a furturistic looking gun, and SHOOTING
AT A DRAGON EGG until it hatches. As soon as this dragon is born, You
jump on top of it, and now have full control over this invincible,
super strong, laser shooting, flying new-born dragon which You use to
mow down thousands of evil laser-shooting bugs and bosses. That scene
alone made this game to me. So cool. &quot; class=&quot;displayleft&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am very interested in beating this game, and I might post a more
thorough look at it when I have done so, but my first impressions with
this game are very positive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The difficulty is high without being impossible, and for a
non-bullet-hell shooter that is a delicate balance to achieve. The
dragon mechanic, by far the most notable aspect of the game, provides
a different experience than most shooters in that You &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; part of
Your “ship” to get hit instead of trying to always avoid every
shot. And the art and music are both very well done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good thing I don’t actually need to feed the machine quarters… I
wonder how long it will take me to beat this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

        <title>[Advance Wars II] Computer Tourney Set Up</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;565 words. Estimated Reading Time: 2 Minutes, 50 Seconds.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;I’ve been playing Advance Wars II lately, and want to
  share the way I set up my computer to play it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/IPdq9at.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/IPdq9at.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The Start of Our Battle&quot; title=&quot;My opponent was Collin; I was Sensei. They immediately attempted to
flood the map with Mech and tank units, trying to etch out an early
victory through the relative cheaper costs they have for
units. I held firm, edging out my forces with a good amount of
paratroopers, holding the line in the center of the map. Here, it
could go either way.&quot; class=&quot;displayleft&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, last Saturday my Brother was in town and we played Advance Wars
II.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really like this game, as it is a fun, simple-to-grasp Turn Based
Strategy game that allows hotseat play. The various characters You can
choose from are interesting, and each one affords a different set of
strategies than all of the others. Add to that the fact that it
supports 4 players and has a built-in map editor, and it’s easy to see
why it is one of my favorite games on the Gameboy Advance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, though, I am not playing it on my Gameboy Advance… I am
instead playing it on my computer, and on my Widescreen Television.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/VxLvxGJ.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/VxLvxGJ.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The End of Our Battle&quot; title=&quot;I was able to hold the line long enough to set up some Missles to
weaken their strong offensive force. They then started to bring in a
few of their own long range units, but it was too late: as soon as
they moved into range, I was able to fire on them, crippling their
efficacy. From that point on, I only needed to slowly march forward,
taking cities as I went to enhance my paratroopers landing range, and
then take out all of their units. Victory was
mine.&quot; class=&quot;displayright&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I own a copy of the game, and was able to produce a ROM image of it
for my own personal use. This, I loaded using
&lt;a href=&quot;http://sourceforge.net/projects/vbam/&quot; title=&quot;This is a port of VisualBoy Advance which is a bit more featureful than stock... plus, it still has a homepage, unlike VBA itself.&quot;&gt;VisualBoy Advance&lt;/a&gt;, which is available for both Windows and
GNU/Linux. I then was faced with a decision, because I wanted to have
it ready that very night: How am I going to unlock more than the 4
starting characters?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, I eventually came to the conclusion that I was going to use a
code. See, while the game itself doesn’t have an ‘unlock everything’
code, there existed for the GBA a few systems like the Game Genie
which allowed people to alter the code of the game. One was Gameshark,
the other was Codebreaker. (NB. I use these as the only examples
because that is what VisualBoy Advance has support for.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided to go with Codebreaker. Below are the Codebreaker codes to
put in to unlock all characters and all costumes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;00009E1F 000A
1006FD98 0007
8202805A FFFF
8202805C FFFF
8202805E FFFF
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just copy that and paste it into the emulator, and all of the COs are
unlocked, allowing for tournament play that very same day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only remaining question then is: Who will win?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Christopher&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>[Da Capo] Shirakawa Kotori&#39;s Route Reflection</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;663 words. Estimated Reading Time: 3 Minutes, 18 Seconds.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tl;dr:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;I just finished Kotori’s Route in Da Capo I!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/gVZcn06.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/gVZcn06.png&quot; alt=&quot;The Starting Screen of Da Capo&quot; title=&quot;Da Capo is a great visual novel by the company Circus. It came out a
while ago, and had a few pretty bad [IMHO] Anime adaptations, but it
still hits me pretty close to home in terms of situation and
emotions. The H Scenes seem kinda tacked on at times, though I have
seen much worse. I personally give it an 8/10.&quot; class=&quot;displayleft&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I just finished playing through Shirakawa Kotori’s route in &lt;em&gt;Da
Capo&lt;/em&gt;. I had a good time, and though I was able to play through the
whole thing in a little more than a day, I found a lot of the moments
to be very memorable. This isn’t a spoiler blog, though, so I won’t go
into too many specifics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major theme which carries through her entire route is the theme of
&lt;em&gt;misunderstanding&lt;/em&gt;. Just about everyone, including You, misunderstands
each other in this storyline… Even little things (Like talking on
the telephone) are made into relatable and memorable events based on
this motif. And dealing with that is a large part of the story, for
better or for worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And, needless to say, there are a few ways to get the worser endings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/ZrBCFwJ.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/ZrBCFwJ.png&quot; alt=&quot;Shirakawa Kotori&quot; title=&quot;Shirakawa Kotori is a very popular girl in our school, who suffers
from having people expect a lot from her no matter what she is
doing. Her story is well written, has a few good twists in it, and
altogether was a nice and memorable experience.&quot; class=&quot;displayright&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another theme present throughout Kotori’s route is being true to
Yourself. This is exemplified in Your character’s choices in regards
to family, friends, and even his own education. There is a lot of
growing up to do along this storyline, and experiencing that again
without feeling like the game is out of touch with reality was a
joy. All in all, a very good experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kotori herself reminds me of a few people I used to know. Perhaps that
is why I find her to be so relatable… It is a very realistic set of
emotions that she carries throughout the story, and she is able to
present them in such a way that, given the circumstances, I can
completely believe that these emotions are genuine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And hey, she is introduced at the beginning of the game as a very
popular person… which (though that is not exactly my case now) I can
say from experience builds up a lot of superficial
relationships. Superficial relationships are (spoiler alert) not very
gratifying IRL or to You or Kotori.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/pbsc0ia.png&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.imgur.com/pbsc0ia.png&quot; alt=&quot;Shirakawa Kotori Ending&quot; title=&quot;I&#39;ve mentioned in the past that my favorite route in this game is
Mako. However, this was a very enjoyable story for a few reasons: I
could relate a lot with the emotions of the main character, especially
in regard to misunderstanding my sigificant other. I liked how some of
the most memorable moments in the game were sharing simple pleasures
like ice cream or singing. And, in the end, I could relate a lot to
Kotori and her issues communicating with people. Definitely not a weak
route in this game.&quot; class=&quot;displayleft&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, I had quite a good time with this. There were only a few
&lt;em&gt;Gotcha!&lt;/em&gt; moments in the choices, and because of this I can easily
recommend Da Capo and Kotori’s route to those looking to do a “real
life” playthrough of a Visual Novel. Anyone who had a middle or high
school romance which survived (or died) due to communication and self
discovery will enjoy this route. I certainly did. And in regard to how
well is stacks up to Your expectations…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s see.&lt;/p&gt;
